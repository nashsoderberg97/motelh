## Background
This experiment was composed of 2 treatment periods. The first treatment period had 3 groups differentiated by their environmental conditions: high temperature (HT), high light (HL), and control (C). The second stress separated each of these 3 groups evenly into 2 groups each: high temperature (HT), and control(C). Separating the corals into 3 groups, and then again splitting each of those groups into 2 resulted in 6 total groups with unique treatment histories.

To monitor the conditions of the corals, one of the things measured along the course of the experiment was fv/fm. This is measured via PAM flourometry. This method is often used to obtain fv/fm values which can be used as a proxy to determine the amount of symbiont cells in a particular coral. 

## Loading the PAM data
The PAM data was saved in .tsv files, which need to be read into a dataframe in R. Also, the date in these dataframes needs to be read as a date as well. 
```{r load_data}
pam01 <- read.table(file = "data/pam/pam20180131.tsv", fill = TRUE, header = T, sep = "\t")
pam01 <- pam01[,1:3]

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
