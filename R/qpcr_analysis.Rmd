```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath(".."))
```

##Load R Package
This will load the R package devtools (installation script commented in), as well as the code for the qPCR plates
```{r libraries}
library(devtools)  # install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrcunning/steponeR")
```
##Loading qPCR Data from a Text File
This will load a .txt file and read the data in it to calculate symbiont/host cell ratios. *NOTE*: in future will need to add a few arguments (flour.num, copy.number, ploidy, extract) in order to use data. For help use "?steponeR"
```{r load_data}
plates <- list.files(path = "data/qpcr", pattern = ".txt", full.names = TRUE)
plates
steponeR(files = plates, delim = "\t", target.ratios = list("C.D"), fluor.norm = list(C = 0, D = 0, Ssid = 0))
```
*NOTE*: The object "plates" is a list of all of the .txt files in the data/qpcr folder
